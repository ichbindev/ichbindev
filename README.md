### ich bin dev

// TODO: add a pretty header picture or something

I'm a full stack dev, here is where I code for fun and learning. I'm currently dealing with some tendonitis in my wrist and trying to minimize the typing I do outside of work, so I'm not as prolific as I'd like to be. It's pretty frustrating but I'm getting in what I can!
