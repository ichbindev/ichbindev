### ich bin dev

Hi! My name is Chris and I'm a product-focused full stack dev with 10 years of experince exploring new opportunities in the Berlin area. I want to work somewhere that I can make a positive impact, both for the company and society. This is my personal account, all code has been written to explore ideas or get hands-on experience with new technology. All of my industry work has been done on separate, less public Github accounts (and unfortunately on some Bitbucket accounts too). I currently live in Austin, Texas but I am actively looking to relocate.
