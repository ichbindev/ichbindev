Or maybe you got here from an old social media post on LinkedIn or Twitter (RIP). In any case, I bet you're wondering what it is you're looking at.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2020, I had the desire to build a blog from scratch. It was that or baking sourdough, right? I was curious about Gatsby and wanted to code every day. I even started not using any CSS frameworks so I could style everything myself. How hard could it be?</p>\n<p>Anyway, I wrote about some of the journey building this blog and other things I learned along the way. I didn't get around to adding comments, and it turns out writing small blips for others to read without any interaction didn't do it for me, and I stopped writing, both blog posts and code for the blog. Additionally, paying $20/year for the ichbin.dev/ domain didn't feel worth it. And without a nice domain, I eventually stopped linking to it and the blog died.</p>\n<p>Awkwardly, because of the Github naming convention for profile READMEs, I'm using the README for this repo actively for my profile bio. Though this blog is unused and not the prettiest, it still didn't feel right to just delete the code. With a little config work, I got the site running on Github pages, so enjoy this little look into my bored quarantine brain.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blog is dead"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/blog/2026-02-20","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/2021-1-15","title":"I'm alive!","tags":["blog"]}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
