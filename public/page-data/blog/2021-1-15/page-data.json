Between the holidays, my wrist, and the passing of my cat I decided to take a break from learning in public. But that's over now! I won't be as active as I was during 100 Days of Code but I definitely plan on being more present.</p>\n<p>I've been working on a portfolio in my spare time, you <a href=\"https://cmlin.ac\">can check it out here!</a>. It's not quite done yet but it's close, mostly fixing up my bio and pictures/descriptions of my work. I also need to implement the contact form and was planning to make it more than just a <code>mailto</code> link. Does anyone even use those anyway?</p>\n<p>Blog-wise, I'd still like to migrate my content to a prettier blog. I built this one from a very small base, but never had strong inspiration to pretty this up. I'm torn in so many directions (blog, portfolio, nutrition app, algorithms) that it's on the back burner for now. I've also had the outline of my 100 Days of Code summary up for a while, I promise to flesh it out and start promoting it, I think I have some very helpful takeaways that can really improve the experience of anyone looking to start.</p>\n<p>Bis später, alligator.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I'm alive!"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/blog/2021-1-15","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-10-26","title":"100 Days of Code","tags":["blog"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/2026-02-20","title":"Blog is dead","tags":["blog"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
