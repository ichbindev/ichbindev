I love customizing stuff so I was holding off since I know I'd end up with way too many keycaps and switches laying around. But my wrist has been awful so I bought an ergonomic one and now I'm hooked. Already ordered some alternative keycaps and switches to play around with.</p>\n<p>Coding wise, today was a lot of wrestling git and Jenkins. I did get localization working for our new application so I'm happy. Long weekend coming up :D</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mechanical Keyboards"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-10-01","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-09-30","title":"/^title$/.match()","tags":["100daysofcode"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-10-02","title":"Injection","tags":["100daysofcode"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
