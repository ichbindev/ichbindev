I've continued to add to the idea of having different topics and made the early stages of a Nav. I want it to go under the home image on the left and to pop out on click or hover.</p>\n<p>I tried using CSS in JSX when I built the early stages and now regret it. It's very fast and easy but changing things becomes a real pain. Once the navigation is done I plan to rip all of that out and replace it with SASS. This will be nice since I'm still not settled on the color scheme and that will enable me to make more comparisons more quickly.</p>\n<p>One issue I'm hitting is when I add pictures to these posts. My blog posts are written in Markdown and I can't add a class or ID to the image so I'm having a hard time styling it. Image size and position are the two big things I'd like to control, I'd just like them to be contained and centered.
