Ended up having to make the repo private sadly, but I'll share the site when it's prettied up. I definitely prioritized functionality over appearance for it.</p>\n<p>I bought a new domain today, can't believe I didn't think of getting <a href=\"www.ichbin.dev\">www.ichbin.dev</a> sooner! Somehow I'd never bought my own domain name before this site so it was interesting to run through the process of getting the DNS resolved and the redirects in place. I knew the theory of how it all worked but it's nice to see it in practice.</p>\n<p>I finally have a free weekend, hoping to fix up the blog a bit more. I'd like to move all of the #100daysofcode items into their own path on the site, so I can keep them and an actual blog with more useful and better written posts ðŸ˜„</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"DNS and Domains"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-07-31","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-07-30","title":"Success!","tags":["blog","100daysofcode"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-01","title":"Reorganizing","tags":["blog","100daysofcode"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
