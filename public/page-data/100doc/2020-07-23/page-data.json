I added a few styling changes but really focused on refactoring what I have. Now that I understand Gatsby better I was able to pull out a few components and get the data to them. I was editing the index file pretty often and realized that it needed to be split into further components.</p>\n<p>I'm far from done but it was a big QoL update on my end so I'm happy. I'm going to keep refactoring and adding more styling to the blog post page. I'll also add a back home button, the picture takes you there but that's not obvious.</p>\n<p>This blog isn't the prettiest but I think it's going more in the right direction.
