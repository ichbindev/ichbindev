So I'm taking it easy, not adding anything to the site, and instead taking some time to look at other blogs and figure out the layout I want.  </p>\n<p>Being a developer doesn't mean you always have to be writing code. Taking some time to think and plan before typing can save you a lot of time and frustration. It can also help keep your code base smaller and more readable since you haven't coded yourself into a corner. Often, legacy code is viewed as bad and hard to work with, but it wasn't necessarily bad to begin with. It was made for one purpose and set of features and over time more and more features and data were added and either conflicted with the orignal design or added by somebody unfamiliar with the code base. You'll never get it perfect but a little extra planning can go a long way, whether your achitecting a new application or adding a boolean to a shared object.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Thinking is Development"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-08-14","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-13","title":"Dropping Drag and Drop","tags":["100daysofcode"]}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
