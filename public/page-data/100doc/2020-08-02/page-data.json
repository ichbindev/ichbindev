Today I did a lot of refactoring for future expansion, which unfortunately doesn't really show on the site. I'm adding tag filtering so I can have regular blog posts on one page, 100 days of code on another, and a combination of all in on list on its own page. You may notice the path has changed, <a href=\"http://www.ichbin.dev/100doc\">www.ichbin.dev/100doc</a> is now serving just 100 days of code posts. That's all there are right now, but it's filtering at least ðŸ˜„</p>\n<p>I also added the site title and some other metadata which were a big miss on my part. Working on all of SEO but haven't filled it all in, but that's fine. These blog posts are mostly for me and don't need to be found in web searches.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Which path?"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-08-02","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-01","title":"Reorganizing","tags":["blog","100daysofcode"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-03","title":"Using filter and sort in the same query","tags":["blog","100daysofcode"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073"]}
