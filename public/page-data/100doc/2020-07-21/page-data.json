Like \"oh that drawing isn't that bad for a 2nd grader\" in 6th grade bad. My handwriting isn't much better. So let's just say that I'm really happy that computers are a thing.</p>\n<p>I don't have to worry about drawing perfect circles or straight lines, but design is still an underdeveloped skill of mine. I try to avoid using templates or pre-made components on personal projects so I can learn the most, but it often ends up in this awkward stage where the UI is good enough to devleop on but not close to a final product. It's just a bunch of loosely grouped items on a page and I have trouble seeing how it will all go together.</p>\n<p>I like to get to this point and finish up some basic functionality before making a wireframe and deciding on the eventual look. This gives me more time to interact with the content and have a better understanding of what the best layout for the site is. After that I'll sketch out a wireframe and start creating that vision.</p>\n<p>Anyone else follow a similar process? Or do you like to wireframe before you write any code? Or do you just wing the entire thing?</p>\n<p>Today is Day 4 of #100daysofcode and it's starting to look like a website. Made the avatar a link back to the home page, wrapped the title with a border the same size as the image, and pulled the list of posts into its own component to facilitate the changes that will need to happen there.</p>\n<p>I need to add some color soon as well, that will make a <em>huge</em> difference. If you have any pet color schemes I'd love to check them out!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"When do you design?"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-07-21","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-07-20","title":"When should I ship?","tags":["blog","100daysofcode"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/100doc/2020-07-22","title":"Let's Start Styling","tags":["blog","100daysofcode"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
