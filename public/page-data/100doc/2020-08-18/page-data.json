I finally split off the blog topics from the 100 days of code topics. Blog view is the default and 100 days of code brings up the tiled, numbered view. Next step is to redo the home page and add more blog posts. I'll need to work on styling blog posts more as I keep adding different elements.</p>\n<p>I also took a few minutes to fix up the mobile view of the site. It's not perfect, but it's no longer really annoying to open a post and read it on phone. Small steps, big difference.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Big Changes"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-08-18","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-17","title":"This and That","tags":["100daysofcode"]}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
