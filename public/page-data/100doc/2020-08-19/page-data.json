I'm happy with the tab order, there's just one nav button I'm trying to fix, it needs to listen to space or enter but only when that button is focused, I can't get it to fire the event but I'll keep trying. I also need to address the contrast, I think the text vs background is good but I want to make sure! I'm ok with some pure style outlines not having enough contrast but everything needs to be readable!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"a11y"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-08-19","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-18","title":"Big Changes","tags":["100daysofcode"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-2-","title":"More a11y","tags":["100daysofcode"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
