Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty used to working with them and traversing them in every which way, but I don't like how they are often used for gatekeeping developer jobs. Generally, web developers won't be using those techniques in their day-to-day work. We deal <em>with</em> trees (like the DOM) daily, but won't need to traverse them manually more than once in a blue moon and god forbid trying to ship a recursive function in production.</p>\n<p>I think we need to stop keeping out people who can do the job because they didn't come from a CS theory background or have time to spend weeks teaching themself something they'll only use in an interview.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Trees"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-08-23","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-22","title":"Waning Motivation","tags":["100daysofcode"]}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
