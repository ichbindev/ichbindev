I do a good job of planning and coding, but as soon as I hit that run button I lose sense of what I was doing. Instead of debugging what happened or rethinking my approach, I just change it a little bit, corss my fingers and run again.</p>\n<p>I'd like to get in the habit of taking it slower. I'm patient before the first run, why can't I be patient about the second? This is a good chance to improve my debugging skills so I'm going to try to be cognizant of my habits going forward.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Plan & Jam"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-08-25","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-24","title":"Algo","tags":["100daysofcode"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-26","title":"Git","tags":["100daysofcode"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
