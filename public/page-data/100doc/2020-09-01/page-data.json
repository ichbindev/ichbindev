Set up a Redux store at work today, I've used it in the past but this was the first time adding it to a larger scale project. It definitely has some quirks but writing reducers is fun. Also managed to proxy through the CORS issue I was hitting with a client I was implementing, now it's time to actually work with the API!</p>\n<p>Algorithms-wise I only did one leetcode problem today, tomorrow is looking light as well. I'm just happy I got to spend a little time on it, this was one I'm actually going to do some more research on to figure out the optimal way to do it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Redux"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-09-01","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-31","title":"Holding Steady","tags":["100daysofcode"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-09-02","title":"Action Creators","tags":["100daysofcode"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
