I did three main things today coding-wise.</p>\n<p>I helped somebody online hook a component up to the store with React/Redux.</p>\n<p>I added to the blog some more real website things. Added a robots.txt and a sitemap. Changed the style a little bit, I like the gray.</p>\n<p>Finally, I ran an audit on the site. I'm happy with the results. The only major issue was color contrast accessibility. I'll need to look at the text color vs the background. The two grays may be too close to distinguish but they are purely stylistic. I'll keep playing around with colors, I hope I can find something accessible that I like.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/ichbindev/ichbindev/blob/master/src/img/blog/audit.png?raw=true%20=100x20\" alt=\"Audit Results: Performance 100, Accessibility 93, Best Practices 92, SEO 98\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Audit"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-08-05","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-04","title":"code coding javascript react","tags":["100daysofcode"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-06","title":"Navigation","tags":["100daysofcode"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073"]}
