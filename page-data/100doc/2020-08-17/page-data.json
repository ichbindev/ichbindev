Unfortunately spent a LOT of time doing dependency resolution today at work and still couldn't get the project to build and use a stupid less file. It's not necessary for my story but it's got to get done at some point.</p>\n<p>In my personal time I decided to do maintenance on some repos and updated some with security vulnerabilities. Then I fixed a bug in this blog where the next post arrow was disappearing. Turns out it's a parenthesis issue and prettier keeps deleting them :'(</p>\n<p>Finally, I kept going with the Apollo tutorial. Taking my time now that I know I'm not immediately implementing it. I hope the extra time leads to a deeper understanding. Their tutorial is pretty dense and it's easy to find yourself just copy pasting the code and not knowing what it's doing.
