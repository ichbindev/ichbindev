It's not always easy to keep track of what you've done and how much you have left. Earlier today I started one before lunch and it turned out to be much longer than I anticipated. I ended up taking a break to eat and lost track and ended up in a bad state earlier today, and it ate up way more time than I had allocated. Couple that with a few other issues and you have a very Sisyphean day of work ðŸ™ƒ</p>\n<p>I did some tech reading in my free time and another leetcode problem, of course. Next up for me is getting more used to writing in TypeScript. Using types is very intuitive but declaring them isn't always.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Automatic merge failed"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-09-03","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-09-02","title":"Action Creators","tags":["100daysofcode"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-09-04","title":"Wrist Pain","tags":["100daysofcode"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
