I did a few more edabit problems, I've really been liking it lately. Leetcode is definitely more difficult but it's nice to have something that I get to figure out how I <em>want</em> to solve it and not <em>how</em> to solve it. It's not so much about finding a working answer but finding the bet answer. I find with leetcode I clean up and optimize a bit but I'm so sick of the harder problems after I solve them. If wish leetcode problems were more practical, I enjoy solving real world problems more than the abstract ones.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Vacation is nice"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-09-27","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-09-26","title":"Out of Town","tags":["100daysofcode"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-09-28","title":"Transition","tags":["100daysofcode"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
