Fourth physical therapy session in the last week along with a doctor appointment took a lot of time out of my day. I kept setting up Redux at work, I actually really like it. I think I even understand Thunks and Action Creators, so that's nice. I'm still a little blocked by the backend for full integration, tomorrow I start integrating whatever I can. There's a LOT to do to get it in a state I'm happy with.</p>\n<p>I did find time to do a leetcode question. Getting in the habit of doing at least once a day is nice. I try to read one in the morning, think about it over the day, and implement it at night. Their difficulty grades are to be taken with a heaving tablespoon of salt, but I like to do this with Medium or Hard (algorithmically) problems. Taking my time means I can think of several different implementations and the tradeoffs between them, so when I start coding it's just a matter of getting the syntax right.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Action Creators"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-09-02","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-09-01","title":"Redux","tags":["100daysofcode"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-09-03","title":"Automatic merge failed","tags":["100daysofcode"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
