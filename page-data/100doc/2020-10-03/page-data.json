That was slower than I wanted, so I added Tailwind. Now, I've been focusing more on algorithms.</p>\n<p>Still, I want more for my site. The next step is probably a homepage/portfolio, and I'd rather spend time reusing components than writing from scratch. Just becuse I can do it doesn't mean I have to.</p>\n<p>I'm spent today exploring what others have done with Gatsby. My current plan is to ad an about page at the root, then redisign and migrate these blog posts.</p>\n<p>My goal is to improve on the frontend, and that means leveraging what already exists a majority of the time. My fundamentals are strong, but I'm realizing how slow building everything from scratch goes when I'm not working on it full time.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Revamp"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-10-03","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-10-02","title":"Injection","tags":["100daysofcode"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-10-04","title":"Terseness","tags":["100daysofcode"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
