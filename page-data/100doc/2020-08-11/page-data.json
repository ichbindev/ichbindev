I'm enjoying the tiles for the list of blog posts, especially for 100 days of code with the numbers on the tile. I think I'll implement something more traditional for other pages and keep the tiles for 100 days of code. I decided since I have tiles I might as well make them drag and drop so the user can reorder them. Who knows, maybe I can let the user mark posts as read or something?</p>\n<p>It sounds fun so I'm going to do it. Looks like react-beautiful-dnd is the way to go. It'll take another day or two of dev to get it working but I think it will be satisfying.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Drag and Drop?"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/100doc/2020-08-11","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-10","title":"What day is it?","tags":["100daysofcode"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/100doc/2020-08-12","title":"It works!","tags":["100daysofcode"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1178078073","4202924991"]}
