Day 10 of #10daysofcode. Had a pretty chill day today where I got to work on the backend for Lonestar. It's the first time I've really used Node/Express in a while and I forgot how much I like it and how easy it is to get going quickly. Authentication is up and working, roles should be there, and I can pass it all to the front end. All that's left to do is restrict page access.

The downside is deployment. It's been a while since I've deployed a MERN app and this one has a LOT of stuff I didn't write (they used a real spray and pray pattern in some places). Theoretically it should just work since it was deployed before but who knows. The owner is having difficulties getting me access to the deployment pipeline so I can't take advantage of that. It's uncertain right now but hopefully it won't be too difficult.
