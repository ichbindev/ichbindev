A full week into \#100daysofcode, Day 7!

I added a link to my LinkedIn and played with some styling on the blog post reader page, as you can see right now if you're reading this.

I got tapped by someone in my bootcamp group for help on a project that needs authentication done before the end of the month, so I'm going to see if I can help him. I'll post some of what I'm doing about that on here and of course I'll keep working on the blog.

I'm glad it's the weekend.
