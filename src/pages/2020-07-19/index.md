I've made the first change to the blog by adding an image. This is the start of the "About Me" component I thought I'd get done today, but I ran into some unforseen difficulties. Long story short, Gatsby has two very similarly named methods, `staticQuery` and `statiqQuery`. I was trying to use the former and ended up with the latter being autocompleted, and unfound naming issues are very difficult to debug.

It's pretty cool once it's set up though. I'm using a GraphQL query to grab the image from the site and it is able to do some transformations and optimizations on it. Of course, I'm using none of that right now but it will be cool for the future.

I didn't get as much added to the blog today as I had hoped but I still have plenty of time. Once I get this section done and everything positioned I will need to actually draw out a wireframe of what I want the rest of the blog to look like.

Github and Twitter links are also a must and coming soon!
