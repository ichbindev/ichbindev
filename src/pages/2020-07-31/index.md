## Day 14

Not too much pure coding today, rewrote a bit of Lonestar to serve a Google form/sheet as a stand-in for while the rest of the app develops. Ended up having to make the repo private sadly, but I'll share the site when it's prettied up. I definitely prioritized functionality over appearance for it.

I bought a new domain today, can't believe I didn't think of getting [www.ichbin.dev](www.ichbin.dev) sooner! Somehow I'd never bought my own domain name before this site so it was interesting to run through the process of getting the DNS resolved and the redirects in place. I knew the theory of how it all worked but it's nice to see it in practice.

I finally have a free weekend, hoping to fix up the blog a bit more. I'd like to move all of the \#100daysofcode items into their own path on the site, so I can keep them and an actual blog with more useful and better written posts ðŸ˜„
