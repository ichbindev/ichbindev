## Day 45

Can't believe I'm almost half way through the hundred days. Not too much to report for today, I can only say I've worked on leetcode problems so many times.

I know their difficulty scores are to be taken with a grain of salt but I really don't get it. I did a 'medium' one that just involved iterating through an array and counting something. Oh well, on to the next one.
