## Day 69

Spent some time today getting the polyfill for async/await to be happy in IE. Thank god for `git bisect` or it would take even longer to figure out what change broke it, since "missing )" isn't very helpful when it works in every other browser.

I'm glad IE has been discontinued but when are we gonna rip off the bandaid?
