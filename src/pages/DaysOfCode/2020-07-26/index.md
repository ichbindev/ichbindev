On to Day 9 of \#100daysofcode. I had a nice visit with the in-laws but they didn't leave until late afternoon. 

I spent some time working on the football recruiting site. I was able to fix the authentication issues pretty quickly, now it's just a matter of what to lock down behind authentication and adding some sort of role permission to account for the different types of users. There's plenty more that can be added there as well.

I took tomorrow off so I'm hoping to do some more work on this blog and read some more of my TDD book.
