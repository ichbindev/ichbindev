## Day 12

Today was rough, I found out that my cat has cancer. He's pretty old (he was a stray so we don't know, but probably 16ish) and has been having a few health issues so it's not out of nowhere, but it still hit really hard. He's been acting fine though, I don't think he's hurting. Scheduling all the appointments he needs tomorrow, I'm hoping he still has a good amount of time left with us.

Coding wise, I continued the fresh site for Lonestar. I'm using authentication that I wrote previously because it fits his needs really well. I'm re-using an old project as a template so I have all of the configurations needed to get it deployed in production quickly. This is the most important reason I chose this site, I tried setting up a pipeline for the previous project but it wasn't the easiest to debug (it was written by a team of people who had only been coding for 2 months) and there was too much uncertainty. It's one of those things that could require one configuration change or four days of chasing error messages and it's impossible to tell before you get your hands dirty.

I will say that working with it has made me appreciate React a lot more. I haven't written something complicated with just HTML/JQuery in a while and I'm really missing the JS and JSX pairing and reusable components.
