## Day 46

Busy day today! Set up a Redux store at work today, I've used it in the past but this was the first time adding it to a larger scale project. It definitely has some quirks but writing reducers is fun. Also managed to proxy through the CORS issue I was hitting with a client I was implementing, now it's time to actually work with the API!

Algorithms-wise I only did one leetcode problem today, tomorrow is looking light as well. I'm just happy I got to spend a little time on it, this was one I'm actually going to do some more research on to figure out the optimal way to do it.
