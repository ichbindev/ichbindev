## Day 49

Almost half way through! And unfortunately I'm gonna have to go light on the coding and writing this weekend. My wrist has been painful for a while and despite seeing a specialist, it's getting worse. He was unable to diagnose what's wrong and after giving me a shot (that he injected into a nerve) and MRI he said the next step is surgery if it doesn't get better. He doesn't know what's wrong but still would do surger, that doesn't raise any red flags. I'm going to see a new specialist soon but going to try to minimize keyboard time until that.

Otherwise I did not do any personal coding today. Any extra free time I had for coding I spent working. Currently writing a function to map our front end data for an internal endpoint and I'm getting a 400 with a vague "didn't match expected" error and no (easy) way to check the logs. Oh well, I'll get it to work. It's an interesting problem and sprint ends on Tuesday so I have multiple reasons to try and get this thing done ðŸ˜„
