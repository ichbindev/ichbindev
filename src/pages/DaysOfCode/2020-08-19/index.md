## Day 33

I spent a good amount of time watching videos on coding for accessibility and working on it on my site. I'm happy with the tab order, there's just one nav button I'm trying to fix, it needs to listen to space or enter but only when that button is focused, I can't get it to fire the event but I'll keep trying. I also need to address the contrast, I think the text vs background is good but I want to make sure! I'm ok with some pure style outlines not having enough contrast but everything needs to be readable!
