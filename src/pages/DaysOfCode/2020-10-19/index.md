## Day 94

Wrist doctor was disappointing. He didn't agree with what the PT thinks I have so I don't even know if the exercises help or hurt at all. He ordered an EMG, and every question (like what's a good position so my nerve doesn't hurt all the time) he just answered with we'll see what the test says. I'm not hopeful on the results finding anything, this get a test and I'll see you in a month to tell you the results stuff is getting really old while I'm in pain. I guess I'll be dealing with this at its worst for a while.

For coding I did some more edabit problems. I can't really handle (well, my wrist can't handle) working a full time job and doing a lot coding on the side, so edabit is perfect for short practices.
