## Day 82

I lost some time today because of the wrist. It distracted me in meetings and I had physical therapy today as well. PT is helping, but it's gonna get worse before it gets better (I definitely prefer numbness to nerve pain), so I need to keep marching forward.

I didn't get to work on the blog today, did a few edabit problems and called the recreational coding. I'm planning on going back to leetcode soon to get even better at algorithms. IMO edabit is for practicing readability in your code and leetcode is for solving hard problems efficiently.
