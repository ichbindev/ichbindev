## Day 41

Free time coding I did today was leetcode again. I got part of the way through a harder problem and completed an easier one pretty quickly. Still learning techniques and developing my mental model.

At work I've been working on a brand new project and really enjoying it. Adding large pieces of code and going quickly, it's a fresh change from the constraints of working inside a large project.
