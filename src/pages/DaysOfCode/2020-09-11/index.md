## Day 56

My wrist is feeling a little better. I'm getting better at typing with right hand only but I still catch myself typing with my left. Can't wait until next week, hopefully I'll get some relief with a steroid shot or anti-inflammatories.

Though I didn't code outside of work, I continued to work on our new endpoint. It's been a while since I was last in Java land so I'm a little rusty, but it's coming back to me. I'll have it up and running soon 💪🏼
