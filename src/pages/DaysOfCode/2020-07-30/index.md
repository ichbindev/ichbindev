## Day 13

I took the day off today. I couldn't focus and I knew I wasn't going to be any real help. I got to spend some good, quality time with Cas and that is definitely my prioriy going forward. He's such a good little guy, we'll find out more about his illness next week.

Managed to get everything working and deployed on Lonestar. It's still a little rough style-wise but it has all the required functionality. I don't know how much more I'll do on it, that depends on the plan my friend comes up with. The site definitely needs to be prettied up a bit and player submission/search still needs to be implemented.
