## Day 22

Today I added Tailwind CSS to the blog! I'm not taking a ton of advantage of it yet, I need to do a little digging to figure out the layout I really want. For now I just made everything look fine with Tailwind running. I'm open to any ideas!

I also threw the excerpt I've been writing under the title of the blog post. I may want to make them a little... better now that they're being displayed. I'd like to also add the date, I'm passing it in but it's not formatted in a good way yet. Moment will take care of that pretty quickly :)
