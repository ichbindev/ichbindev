## Day 65

I've been solving a few edabit problems lately. They're not too different but different enough to feel fresh. Gonna focus on regexes a little more then move on to SQL. I don't think I've written a very complicated query without existing queries to reference since college. It's all been ORM and DBA in my career. I know the concepts but no longer remember the syntax, time to kick the rust!
