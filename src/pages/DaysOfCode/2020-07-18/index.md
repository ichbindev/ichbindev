Hello! I've decided to give \#100DaysOfCode a try. Even though I've been coding daily I've decided to make what I'm working on more public and get some writing practice. Posts in the 100 Days of Code path will be brief and very stream-of-consciousness. As I flesh out this blog I'll have a platform to share blog posts that are meant to be more helpful instead of tracking like these are.

Thank you for joining my journey, I hope you enjoy seeing the site evolve over the next 99 days.
