Welcome! I just put together this small blog as Day 1 of \#100daysofcode. I've been doing daily coding to learn new things regularly but would also like to write what I do more, so I'm trying that in this little blog. Definitely going to do a lot of tweaks to this blog over the next 100 days, I'm excited to see how it and other projects turn out.
