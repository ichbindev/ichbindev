## Day 18

Hi everyone! Today I worked on the SEO component for this blog. It's not really my goal to gain traffic at this blog for #100daysofcode but it's definitely worth learning how to set SEO oriented tags in Gatsby.

In other news, we finally got an appointment to take my cat to see an internal medicine specialist this morning. He may have bladder cancer and may have lymphoma, or it could be a polym and inflammation respectively. They'd have to do a pretty big surgery on him just to get the biopsy to officially diagnose it, but we don't think it's worth putting him through that. We've decided to treat the symptoms and start chemotherapy drugs today. According to the vet they should be mild and have little chance of side effects, so we'll see how he does on them and go from there. This guy's a trooper, his kidneys failed two years ago and he went blind for a few days last year and he's still kickin'.
