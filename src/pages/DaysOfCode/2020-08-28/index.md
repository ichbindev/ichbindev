## Day 42

Well this is embarrasing. After getting _another_ tree problem I decided to look at what it was doing. Turns out I accidentally clicked on the 'Trees' filter 🤦🏻‍♂️

So I finished the tree problem I was on and now I can finally do something else. Oddly enough I never hit a problem that required BFS. I should probably do that.
