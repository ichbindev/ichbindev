## Day 51

I debugged a leetcode problem that I solved most of yesterday. Off by one error, naturally. That was all the coding I let myself do while I continue to let my wrist rest. 

Even though I can't write today code I can still read about it ðŸ˜„ I picked up Test Driven Development again today. I need to make reading (and practicing) it a priority. I think it will help me be so much more confident in the code 'i write.
