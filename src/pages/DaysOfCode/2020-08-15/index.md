## Day 29

I did a little sorely needed styling on the blog page. Since I added tailwind all of the style was stripped from default elements, and since markdown doesn't add classes everything was just a giant blob of text. I've added some styling to make it distinguishable but it'll need some more focus and attention.

I started learning Apollo today. I've heard a lot of good things and like what I've seen of GraphQL, so why not? New project at work is getting just to the point of needing state management so I hope to understand enough by Monday to implement Apollo instead of Redux. This project is a lot smaller and more lightweight than our other projects so it's a great place to try it out.
