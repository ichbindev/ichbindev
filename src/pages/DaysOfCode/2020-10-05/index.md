## Day 80

Started up the project for a new blog. I like the basics that were in the template, I just need to strip out everything I don't need and put my own spin on that. The blog schema is also a little different, so I'll have to decide on how I want to handle the differences and migrate the posts I have. Looking forward to getting it out there but it's gonna be a few more days.
