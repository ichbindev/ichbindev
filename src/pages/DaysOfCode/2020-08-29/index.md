## Day 43

I did a bunch of array problems today. I like them better than trees, more intuitive to me and used much more frequently. I'm comfortable with the FP in JavaScript but I can always make it feel more natural.

Github permissions continue to be messed up. Turning on 2FA was a bad idea. I just want to get back to a point where I can push my code without 10 minutes of wrestling the command line.
