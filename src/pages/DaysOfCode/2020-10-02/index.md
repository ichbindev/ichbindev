## Day 77

Today, I had an injection to dull my sural nerve which is sending me constant pain signals. The feeling will be down for a few days, and if I like it we may remove the nerve.

Coding-wise, I spent some more time on edabit. I definitely feel better with regexes now, I'm just going to practice some more to get them down. Over 6 years in software dev and I've only used them a handfull of times. Easy enough to look up but I wanna be able to write 'em all myself üòè
