## Day 73

Although I've been a full stack dev for over 6 years, a majority of my first five were spent on the backend. I was able to take some time during my recovery to improve on the front end and have been loving it since. I'm thinking about going frontend full time, but I've got a lot of work to do to be where I'd like to be as a front end developer. Gotta keep learning and chugging, I'll get there eventually.
