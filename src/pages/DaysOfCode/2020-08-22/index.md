## Day 36

I'm a little over 1/3 of the way through 100 days of code and getting kinda bored of it. Not of the coding itself, just the writing about it every day.

The point of this was to get me to write every day though, so I will keep it up. I could certainly improve as an engineer, but the writing about it is just as important as the coding practice is.

Today I did some leetcode problems. I've finally crossed over the hump where it's a chore to do them and now they're fun. I wish they were a little more real-world or had more context though. What kind of web dev needs to traverse a tree recursively in his day to day?
