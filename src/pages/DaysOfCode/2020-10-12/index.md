## Day 87

I decided to start picking up Go. It's really popular and I want to see what all the fuss is about. Unfortunately I'll have to rely more on reading than hands-on-keyboard (ouch!) but I'm looking forward to getting a good frame of reference with Go and write a few backends in it when I can type freely.
