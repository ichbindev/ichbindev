## Day 52

Sprint closes tomorrow, only 3 weeks left in the quarter. Having a rough time with this new project, it's my first greenfield application at this company and as a team we missed a lot of project set-up stuff and keep adding it to the pile. It's gonna be a fun next few weeks. I put in a little time today to help close what we can for the sprint but there is still a LOT to do.

That's all of the coding I did today. Resting wrists otherwise. We've been doing a lot of pair programming lately. I really like it. Faster, less mistakes, and some much needed social interaction. Gonna talk to my manager and see if she's good with me driving sparingly when pair programming. Calling up a hand/wrist specialist tomorrow and got some exercises to do from my physical therapist today, definitely want to put this in the rear view mirror.
