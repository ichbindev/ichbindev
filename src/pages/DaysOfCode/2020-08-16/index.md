## Day 30

Wow, can't believe it's already been 30 days! I had my parents visit this weekend and it was the first time I've seen them in months, so I didn't get too much done. 

I'm continuing to look at Apollo and make it through the tutorial. I'll have more time to put aside to finish it tomorrow night I hope. I'm enjoying it, but I still don't 'get' it. I've used GraphQL through Gatsby before so that's not foreign to me, but I'm looking forward to working with it. I might not be able to learn it fast enough to implement it on our current project but I'll talk to the team about it. We have a dev on a sister team really advocating for it and I have to say it does look nice.

Other than that I did a minor styling change on the blog. Still planning on redoing the landing page and maybe even writing some real blog posts, but since Apollo is time sensitive it's on the back burner for now.
