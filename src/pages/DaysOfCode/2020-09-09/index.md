## Day 54

Today was pretty standard for code. I watched some Egghead talks over lunch, both were great, especially the one on mental health.

Transitioning to physical health, my wrist is still annoying at best and painful at worst. I had an appointment with a specialist a few months ago to look at it and he gave me a steroid injection. He hit a nerve and it took a long time to calm down. I got an MRI that didn't show anything exciting and he said I could either wait and see if it got better or have surgery to take a look at if he could find anything wrong in there. I don't think I need surgery (at least not yet) so I'm seeking out another specialist to get some fresh eyes on it, and hopefully an injection that doesn't hit the nerve. One more week of one handed typing before I get it looked at ðŸ˜µ
