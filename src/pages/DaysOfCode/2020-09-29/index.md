## Day 74

This whole wrist pain while typing for a living thing sucks. I finally got a diagnosis today at physical therapy (Guylon's Tunnel Syndrome) so at least I have a plan of attack. I really don't understand why it took four doctors and a physical therapist to get heard. A few weeks of physical therapy and hopefully I'll be able to type without pain/numbness.
