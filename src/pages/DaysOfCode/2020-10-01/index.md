## Day 76

I broke down and bought a mechanical keyboard. I love customizing stuff so I was holding off since I know I'd end up with way too many keycaps and switches laying around. But my wrist has been awful so I bought an ergonomic one and now I'm hooked. Already ordered some alternative keycaps and switches to play around with.

Coding wise, today was a lot of wrestling git and Jenkins. I did get localization working for our new application so I'm happy. Long weekend coming up :D
