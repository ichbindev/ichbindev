## Day 15 of 100DaysOfCode

I didn't get to do too much coding today, but I did start the process of reorganizing this blog. I've decided I want 100DaysOfCode to be its own page so I can also add regular blog posts without the noise. I've changed the paths off all of my posts, the next thing to do is to filter based on tags and URL or something. I'm still learning Gatsby so I have to figure out the best way to do this, probably going to check the path and filter tags to show on the list based on the URL.

Either way it's going to take some trial and error but worth it in the end. This will also give me more to do on this site since I can add navigation. Now that I've calmed down on other projects I have some more time to spend on getting this looking right!
