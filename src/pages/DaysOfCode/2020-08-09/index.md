## Day 23

I did a lot today. Fully integrated Tailwind and started tearing down the old styling and implementing some new stuff. Site is starting to get pretty. Working on some GraphQL to get filtering tags right next for category filtering is the next thing, as well as adding the post number to every tile in the 100doc path. Probably adding date and reading time at some point as well :)
