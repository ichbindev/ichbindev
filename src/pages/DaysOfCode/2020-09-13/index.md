## Day 58

I managed do do a leetcode problem with one hand. That's impressive, right?

Rearranged my desk to make it harder to use my left hand to type. I find myself doing it without thinking way too often and don't notice until it starts burning after 30 seconds or so. Really hoping the doctor can come through I am weary of another steroid shot.
