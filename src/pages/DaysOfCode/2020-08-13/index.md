## Day 27

Unfortunately the Drag and Drop didn't work well. I used react-beautiful-dnd to create it but they do not support grids (or flexbox wrap) so I could really only pick a line to put it instead of a place. It was fun but not what I invisioned. I tore it out of my code, which felt good. I have a few other libraries to check out, I may do that or something else shiny might catch my eye.
