## Day 24

I did two date-focused things today. I added the day number to the tiles __[on the 100 days of code](/100doc/)__ page and added the date to every post. I like how this looks for 100 days of code and will probably keep this page tiled but I'll see about design for the main blog. I also am having trouble thinking of the best way to solve a bug, on the first post the 'next' arrow floats left since there is no previous arrow to push it to the right ðŸ¤”

I created a new repo for another side project, some friends and I have a domain set up that just directs to a Discord invite but we're gonna (re)make a splash page for it. Gatsby, Tailwind, and silly, snarky quotes incoming.
