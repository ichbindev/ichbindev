## Day 90

Today I spent some time watching some React Summit talks, really liked [@NikkitaFTW]()'s talk about `useEffect`. I feel really comfortable with `useEffect` but there are always little corner cases I haven't seen yet.

Next week I'm doing a React performance workshop hosted by Kent C. Dodds, looking forward to that!
