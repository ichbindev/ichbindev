## Day 39

As I continue to work on some leetcode problems I noticed a bad habit I have. I do a good job of planning and coding, but as soon as I hit that run button I lose sense of what I was doing. Instead of debugging what happened or rethinking my approach, I just change it a little bit, corss my fingers and run again.

I'd like to get in the habit of taking it slower. I'm patient before the first run, why can't I be patient about the second? This is a good chance to improve my debugging skills so I'm going to try to be cognizant of my habits going forward.
