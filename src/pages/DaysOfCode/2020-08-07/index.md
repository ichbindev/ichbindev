## Day 21

Did a little more restructuring of the blog today. Worked on the Nav a bit as well, just have to add the show/hide logic and animation and it's good to go. I also took some time to practice some TypeScript. 

Cas started his chemo drugs today. He was pretty grumpy about it but he's a champ.
