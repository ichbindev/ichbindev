## Day 78

I started this site just a few days before I started 100DaysOfCode with the intention of writing everything by hand. That was slower than I wanted, so I added Tailwind. Now, I've been focusing more on algorithms.

Still, I want more for my site. The next step is probably a homepage/portfolio, and I'd rather spend time reusing components than writing from scratch. Just becuse I can do it doesn't mean I have to.

I'm spent today exploring what others have done with Gatsby. My current plan is to ad an about page at the root, then redisign and migrate these blog posts.

My goal is to improve on the frontend, and that means leveraging what already exists a majority of the time. My fundamentals are strong, but I'm realizing how slow building everything from scratch goes when I'm not working on it full time.
