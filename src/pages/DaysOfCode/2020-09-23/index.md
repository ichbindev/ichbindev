## Day 68

Today my mentee, who started at our company out of college a few months ago, was moved to a different team. I really enjoyed helping him and seeing him grow. I learned a lot about how others learn and more about how to teach. I'll still be in regular contact with him but it won't be the same. I'm gonna miss those long zoom calls and stupid bugs we worked on.
