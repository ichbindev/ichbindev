## Day 55

After some discussion we've redesigned the project I'm working on and a lot of what I wrote last week is going to be re-written in a different service and a different language. Sometimes you gotta take a step back and do it differently when you learn new information. Just because you've written code doesn't mean you have to use it.

Spending a little more time at the beginning can save you a lot of time throughout the life of the project.
