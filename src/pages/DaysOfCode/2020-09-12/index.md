## Day 57

I took some time to research and update my CV today. I think it's important to update it as you go. I'm happy with my job but especially with COVID, it's important to have it ready for whenever it is needed. This also allows you to better remember projects and accomplishments instead of scrambling to get it together if you get laid off.

I also worked on interview prep from the interviewer side. It's been a little while and I had some new ideas I wanted to get written down. I did a mock interview earlier this week as the interviewer and that's always something that can be improved on.
