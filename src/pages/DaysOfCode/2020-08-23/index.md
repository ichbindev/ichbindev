## Day 37

Added two more leetcode problems I worked through today. I've just been clicking on random, solving it, then moving on to the next one. No skipping, I won't be learning if I just do the ones I think are fun.

Of course almost, all of them have been tree problems. Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty used to working with them and traversing them in every which way, but I don't like how they are often used for gatekeeping developer jobs. Generally, web developers won't be using those techniques in their day-to-day work. We deal _with_ trees (like the DOM) daily, but won't need to traverse them manually more than once in a blue moon and god forbid trying to ship a recursive function in production.

I think we need to stop keeping out people who can do the job because they didn't come from a CS theory background or have time to spend weeks teaching themself something they'll only use in an interview.
