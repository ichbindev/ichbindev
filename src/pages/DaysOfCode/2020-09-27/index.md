## Day 72

I had a nice trip but very happy to be home and spend tonight in my bed. I did a few more edabit problems, I've really been liking it lately. Leetcode is definitely more difficult but it's nice to have something that I get to figure out how I _want_ to solve it and not _how_ to solve it. It's not so much about finding a working answer but finding the bet answer. I find with leetcode I clean up and optimize a bit but I'm so sick of the harder problems after I solve them. If wish leetcode problems were more practical, I enjoy solving real world problems more than the abstract ones.
