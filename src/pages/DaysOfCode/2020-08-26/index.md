## Day 40

I continued working on some leetcode problems. Did one with counting the zigzags in a tree which I thought was fun. Unfortunately, git decided it didn't like my ssh key anymore and it took a little while to make it happy and let me push again. I love using git but it can definitely be frustrating.
