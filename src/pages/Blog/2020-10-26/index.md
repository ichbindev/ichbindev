I write this having just finished the 100 Days of Code challenge and would like to share my takeaways from the last few months. I'll break my thoughts down into a few categories. The aim for this post is to help others plan out their 100 days.

This post is under construction and will be updated. I'm dealing with a wrist injury and plan on pecking away at this in free time.
