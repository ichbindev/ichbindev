title: "100 Days of Code"
---

I write this having just finished the 100 Days of Code challenge and would like to share my takeaways from the last few months. I'll break my thoughts down into a few categories. The aim for this post is to help others plan out their 100 days.

This post is under construction and will be updated. I'm dealing with a wrist injury and plan on pecking away at this in free time.

## What I Wanted to Do

- Learn
- Grow
- Write

## What I Did

- Jumped around on topics
- Shallow but not deep

## What I Learned

- TypeScript
- Go
- TDD
- Gatsby
- GraphQL

## What I Wish I Did

- Read more, especially code
- More open source (pick one, don't try to do a little bit for a lot of projects)
- More productivity tricks (IDE stuff)
- watch coding livestreams
- Deploy personal projects to the cloud (aws probably), especially serverless

## If I Were Starting Today, I Would... (summary)
- Not 100 contiguous days, probably 60 in 90 or something
- Have a schedule/curriculum or one specific project to work on
- Tough to do when your day job is also coding
