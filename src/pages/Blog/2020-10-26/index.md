title: "100 Days of Code"
---

I write this having just finished the 100 Days of Code challenge and would like to share my takeaways from the last few months. I'll break my thoughts down into a few categories. The aim for this post is to help others plan out their 100 days.

This post is under construction and will be updated. I'm dealing with a wrist injury and plan on pecking away at this in free time.

## What I Wanted to Do

- Learn
- Grow
- Write
- Create blog from scratch

## What I Did

- coded or did something code related every day
- Jumped around on topics
- Shallow but not deep

## What I Learned

- TypeScript
- Go
- TDD
- Gatsby
- GraphQL
- More CSS
- More internals on JS/React

## What I Wish I Did

- Read more, especially code
- More open source (pick one, don't try to do a little bit for a lot of projects)
- More productivity tricks (IDE stuff)
- watch coding livestreams
- Deploy personal projects to the cloud (aws probably), especially serverless
- Building from the ground up is fun and educational, but start with a template or at least css framework to make dev go faster. So much time tweaking the blog when others are available and I could focus on more features
- Pretty landing page
- avoided wrist issue

## If I Were Starting Today, I Would... (summary)
- Not 100 contiguous days, probably 60 in 90 or something. Some days you don't want to and that's OK, but phoning it in to say you did it that day really makes it easy to keep just phoning it in
- Go deep! Pick or start a project that includes the tools you would like to use and have that be what you work on for the 100 days
  - make sure you can complete it (or an MVP) in the 100 days and extend to it later
- break out really small tasks, have something doable in a day and direction

- Have a schedule/curriculum or one specific project to work on
- Set a concrete goal/commitment for each day
- Tough to do when your day job is also coding

## The Biggest Takeaway

Tech is deep. You can't learn it all, especially on an hour a day. Deliberate practice is very important so have quality time to focus. Take breaks, no need for consecutive days. Forcing it some days makes it easier to be more lenient on days you do have the time and energy. A goal like 60 days of code in a 90 day period is more optimal for me.
