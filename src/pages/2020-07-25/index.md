Day 8 of \#100daysofcode in the books and it's a pretty light one. I tweaked the styling a bit on this blog and started looking at a friend's project that needs some help. Gotta fix user login then lock some pages behind user roles so it shouldn't be too bad, but this was also written by new devs in the middle of a bootcamp so I'm sure it will have its own little idiosyncrasies.
